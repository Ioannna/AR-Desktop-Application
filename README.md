# Scope
This application is a personal project that I designed for students of high school,
which enables them to have a more realistic experience of how a real motherboard
is looking like.

# Holo-SDK
Holo-SDK is a Unity plugin that enables the creation of hollographic illusion 
of the 3D model of the motherboard by tracking the users head position and render
scenes according to the using perspective.
